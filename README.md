# Hi, I'm Maykel ðŸ‘‹

**I am a digital product builder who focuses on the intersection of design, engineering and business strategy.**

Previously, I led the digital product and design team at Glossier, worked on a myriad of efforts and product teams at Facebook, and was one of the first designers on the Instagram team.

When not building things, I like to spend time helping others with their careers and their teams, and advising their businesses.

### Work History ðŸ§¾

Here is a brief history of what I have been up to professionally in the last decade and a half.

#### Now: On Hiatus

Taking a break to do some consulting, advising, investing, and playing with some new ideas. If youâ€™d like to chat, please reach out!

#### 2018 â€“ 2019: Glossier

As Head of Digital Product and Design at Glossier, I helped transform the digital product management and design team, by hiring some amazing people to the product and design team, focusing the team on driving measurable results, and creating a brand new design system.

#### 2014 â€“ 2018: Facebook

At Facebook I worked at the intersection of design and product strategy, leading a re-design of the search engine, supporting multiple efforts on the local team (including a prototype of hyperlocal with bluetooth beacons), and leading the product experimentation team.

#### 2011 â€“ 2014: Instagram

As one of the earliest members of the Instagram team, I worked as a designer (and sometimes engineer) â€” most notably on: redesigning instagram.com (including our move to React), and re-designing for iOS7.

#### 2006 â€“ 2011: Airglow Studios

As design co-founder, I led all of the design and creative efforts, as well as general company strategy â€” shifting us through our transformation from a web studio to focus on apps and games across web and mobile.
