# Hi, I'm Maykel ðŸ‘‹

## I am a digital product builder who focuses on the intersection of design, engineering and business strategy.

Previously, I led the digital product and design team at Glossier, worked on a myriad of efforts and product teams at Facebook, and was one of the first designers on the Instagram team.

When not building things, I like to spend time helping others with their careers and their teams, and advising their businesses.
